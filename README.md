Repository for OLS Nebula Cohort 1 project

## Welcome
The project concerns the protection of human rights and environmental defenders and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), with an emphasis on early warnings and protection measures in the virtual space, especially through social media. Social media is a relevant tool to enhance the visibility and advocacy of human rights defenders and spread information on disasters, but at the same time might also escalate threats without appropriate protection mechanisms. Technology companies have the data that if adequately used can contribute to timely information on risks, conflict management and save lives. For instance, during Carnival, some samba schools pay tribute to human rights defenders, such as indigenous people, which increases their visibility on the networks but also the risks to which they are exposed.In a country as Brazil that ranks 4th in the world for murders of human rights and environmental defenders, and considering the development of technology, research must dedicate to address the topic.
In this sense, the project aims to assess the extent to which technology companies, especially those that own social media platforms, can contribute to the protection of human rights and environmental defenders, through mapping gaps and  good practices and developing tools to measure and communicate risks. Whether and how AIoT can be a basis for achieving the goal of protection in the digital environment.
AIoT can be defined as the combination of AI with IoT to create more efficient and data-driven interconnected, intelligent, and autonomous IoT systems and infrastructure that use AI methods and algorithms.
AIoT as a field is currently in its infancy but has demonstrated great potential to influence and
transform several sectors and be a leading aspect in achieving a sustainable future.
The main purpose of the research is to define forms of protection by technology companies, taking into account the due diligence mechanisms contained in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
In this context, the project can be a basis for scientific diplomacy with the aim of disseminating the best protection practices made available by the platforms, taking into account the specificities of different political regimes, democracies or dictatorial systems around the world.
The project aims to involve initiatives from the UN B-Tech projects and the UN SDGs, as a way of contributing to the fulfillment of the proposal to achieve SDG 16: "Peace, Justice and Effective Institutions".

## What are we doing 

We have collected data about violence against human rights defenders in Brazil: types of violence (attack, threats, murders, criminalization, delegitimization, physical assault, sexual harrassment and suicide), victims (sex, race, ethnic group, profession, advocacy theme), perpetrators and locations. 
Based on this data, we are suggesting codes for searching on social media that may indicate geolocated threats creating alerts that can help prevent attacks. We are also developing a communication prototype between the platforms, social network users and the authorities.
A major challenge is the objective definition of real risks, considering the spread of hate speech on networks, which is why the effectiveness of the project requires human action.
At the same time, we are researching comparative law to define the possibilities of civil responsibility for platforms, including to ... legislative proposals in Brazil

### The problem 
How to use open source to provide information to human rights  defenders on the levels of risk they are facing?

### Hypothesis
Using codes and AI technology we can research open data to map the risks human rights defenders are facing. A combination of name, geolocation and key threaten phrases will provide information on the risks. Those risks will be  classified by levels and sent to the human rights defenders.  This approach aims at reducing the risks of death and attacks against human rights defenders.

### What we are working on 

We are selecting datas and cases to create a risk framework.

## Who are we 

We are a team of three Federal Public Defenders from Brazil, all mothers of two kids, mentored by Monica Granados during OLS Nebula Cohort.

Ana Luisa Zago de Moraes is PhD in Criminal Sciences. She was the Director of Defense of Human Rights at the Human Rights Ministery of Brazil. At Public Defenders Office, she cofounded and coordinated the Working Group on Migration, Refugee, and Statelessness; and the Ethics Human Rights and Artificial Intelligence research group. She was the chief editor of Federal Public Defenders Magazine. She teaches international criminal law courses in lato sensu graduate courses and develops research on the following topics: human rights, migration policy, criminal policy and transitional justice. 

Lutiana Valadares Fernandes Barbosa is a postdoctoral researcher at UFMG.  Holds a Ph.D. in international law from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, an LL.M from PUC-MG, and an LL.M from Columbia University. She was the coordinator of the National Working Group on Migration, Refugee, and Statelessness at the Federal Public Defender´s Office and coordinated the Ethics Human Rights and Artificial Intelligence research group at the National School of the Federal Public Defender´s Office. She is currently a personal associate at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

Viviane Ceolin Dallasta Del Grossi is a PhD student in Human Rights at the University of São Paulo (USP). Master's in Human Rights from USP. Master's in Criminology and Criminal Enforcement from Pompeu Fabra University (inter-institutional degree from the University of Girona and the Autonomous University of Barcelona - Barcelona, Spain, 2014). Postgraduate in Public Law, with an emphasis on International Human Rights Law. Member of the Ethics, Human Rights and Artificial Intelligence Research Group (EDHIA/ENADPU/DPU).
